# VE.Direct

## **Theory**

The VE.Direct protocol is a communication interface developed by Victron Energy, primarily for their energy monitoring products. This protocol is designed for real-time data exchange between devices like Battery Management Systems (BMS), solar charge controllers, and various monitoring devices. VE.Direct uses a simple serial connection with a standard UART interface, enabling data transfer at a low baud rate (commonly 19,200 bps). This protocol is especially useful for monitoring device metrics, such as voltage, current, and battery capacity, which can be helpful for energy management and control.

Data in VE.Direct is mainly transmitted as ASCII text in a predefined message format, making it easy to parse and interpret. During setup of a new connected device, there might be also hex strings transmitted. The protocol's simplicity is a double-edged sword: while it’s efficient for quick data retrieval, the lack of encryption or authentication makes it susceptible to interception or manipulation if physical access is available. This feature is crucial for pentesters as it opens the door for potential vulnerabilities, especially if critical devices rely on VE.Direct for automated decision-making processes.

## **Attacks**

### Sniffing

To sniff what data is send over VE.Direct we can use tools like an UART-to-TTL USB adapter or Saleae Logic Analyzer:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UART-to-TTL" %}
We have to connect RX,TX and GND to our adapter and start minicom etc. on baud rate 19200

```bash
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 19200
sudo picocom -b 19200 -r -l /dev/ttyUSB0
```

The output may look like this: (Serial number blanked)

```

SER#    XXXXXX
V       11680

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Saleae Logic" %}
Connect GND, RX and TX to your Saleae and start an Async Serial Analyzer at baud rate 19200

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Spoofing

Since the VE.Direct protocol does not require authentication, we can also spoof our own packages and send them to the control panel, which will then be accepted. Therefore we can simply record a original message and then replay it. We can also change every parameter of this message, this however requires us to change the Checksum accordingly.
