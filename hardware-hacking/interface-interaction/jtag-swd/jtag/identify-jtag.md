# Identify JTAG

### 1. **Reminder of the Basics of JTAG**

JTAG is typically implemented using the following standard signals, which we need to find:

* **TDI**: Test Data In
* **TDO**: Test Data Out
* **TCK**: Test Clock
* **TMS**: Test Mode Select
* **TRST**: Test Reset (optional)

### 2. **Preliminary Examination**

* **Inspect the PCB Layout**
  * Look for **pin headers** or **test points** with 4-10 pins in a row or dual row configuration.
  * Check for labeled pads or silkscreen markings such as **JTAG**, **TDI**, **TDO**, etc.
  * Examine components for known JTAG-compatible chips (e.g., ARM Cortex processors, FPGAs).
* **Consult the Datasheet**
  * Identify major ICs on the PCB and locate their datasheets online. Search for:
  * JTAG or boundary scan capabilities.
  * Pin numbers corresponding to JTAG signals.
* &#x20;**Look for Clues**
  * Use magnification to inspect nearby traces. JTAG pins often connect directly to the processor or debug interfaces.
  * Check for standardized pinouts like ARM’s 20-pin or 10-pin connectors.

### 3. **Test for Common JTAG Pinouts**

Here are a few common JTAG pinouts to reference:

### 4. **Electrical Verification**

* **Check Pin Voltage Levels**
  * Using a multimeter, measure the voltage on suspected pins when the device is powered on:
    * **TDI, TDO, TMS, TCK**: Typically operate at 1.8V, 3.3V, or 5V.
    * **GND**: Should read 0V.
    * **Vcc**: Will match the system voltage (e.g., 3.3V or 5V).
* **Probe Continuity**
  * Use a multimeter in continuity mode to trace suspected pins:
    * Test connections between suspected pins and the processor’s JTAG pins (refer to the datasheet).
    * Identify Vcc and GND connections to nearby capacitors or power lines.

Depending on the GND and VCC pins  we can limit the number of possible JTAG pinouts!

### 5. **Verification Using Test Tools**

**a) Use a JTAG Finder**

Tools like JTAGulator or Bus Pirate can assist in identifying JTAG signals by probing the pins automatically.

b) **Connect a Debugger**

1. Attach a known JTAG debugger (e.g., OpenOCD or Segger J-Link) to the suspected interface.
2. Use debugging software to scan for a JTAG chain.
3. Look for a valid response to confirm the JTAG interface.

### 6. **Analyze Signal Activity**

a) **Use an Oscilloscope or Logic Analyzer**

1. Monitor pin activity during device operation or reset.
2. Look for:
   * Clock signals on **TCK**.
   * Data transitions on **TDI**, **TDO**, or **TMS**.

b) **Identify Pull-Up Resistors**

Check if certain pins have pull-up resistors to Vcc, which is common for **TMS** or **TDI**.
